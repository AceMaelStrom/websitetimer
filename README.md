# websitetimer
so basically this is a test website because i dont know how to code in HTML, CSS, or JS. There's a main website and then there's buttons to navigate to the next one through a continue button. I doubled the main page as a typical 2007 page, with the usual lack of coherence and a meme here or there. there is one website you have to type in the link though. i launched this on netlify so where you see the name like nextpage, index, etc., just replace it with a certain code in a certain code comment. also plan to update this along the way; btw this websitetimer thing lost the plot entirely

git clone https://github.com/AceMaelStrom/websitetimer

go do cd websitetimer

to deploy/build: its all js, css, and html so just clone it using link above and should work; if not the webpage https://testsiter.netlify.app/ is the website online;

btw once you clone my repo from the git link up there you double click the index.html file, so the thing runs(there is one web address you will have to type in, the address in encrypted somewhere)




also npm install liveserver cause that's really important if you want to run from vscode, so you can double-click index.html


shoutout to santa aditya and aryan rao for making me realize the internet is a wide place where you can search up answers to problems; i would be stuck otherwise
